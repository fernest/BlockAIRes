# BlockAIRes
Depostory is dedicated to the project **"Resolving research reproducibility problems in Artificial Intelligence using Blockchain Technologies BlockAIRes"**

The main project's objective is to contribute resolving research reproducibility problems in the Artificial Intelligence field and enhance the research cycle by developing a conceptual model of a blockchain-based decentralized platform, which would be efficient, scalable, interoperable, and adaptable in various Artificial Intelligence research domains.
